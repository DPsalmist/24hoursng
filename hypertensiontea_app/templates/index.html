                            <p>Dear friend, <br><br>
                              Have you always battled with Hypertension or cardiovascular problems and have been looking for a way out? <br><br>
                              Do you also have high blood sugar levels and want to normalize it quickly? <br><br>
                              When was the last time you breathed freely without difficulty or irregular heart beat in your chest?<br><br>
                              Do you experience severe headaches, vision problems, nose bleeds or blood in urine?<br><br>
                              Do you experience pounding in the chest, neck or ears?<br><br>
                              If you are experiencing any of the above, then there is a high risk of a hypertension and related cardiovascular condition........... <br><br>
                              If nothing is done and quickly too and in more advanced cases, death is not far.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="has-text-centered" style="color: red;">Why Regulate Your Blood Pressure?</h3>
                            <p> 
                              <i>This Tea starts reversing high blood pressure after you take it and continues eliminating hypertension without any side effects. </i> <br><br>
                              Nearly 70% of persons suffer <strong>First Heart Attack</strong> as a result of high blood pressure.
                              An increasing blood pressure could be caused by family history, especially if your parents or other close relatives have high blood pressure.
                              Also we are exposed to enormous stress on daily a basis especially in Nigeria. <br>
                              Your body produces a surge of hormones when you're in a <b>stressful</b> situation. These hormones increase your blood pressure by causing your heart to beat faster and your <b>blood</b> vessels to narrow. <br>
                              Smoking, drinking too much alcohol and eating unhealthy foods leads to high blood pressure too.
                            </p>
                          <h3 class="has-text-centered" style="color: red;">What is Hypertension?</h3>
                          <p>
                            It is usually refereed to as “Silent Killer”. <br> <br>
                            Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. <br> <br> Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump. <br><br>
                            Hypertension is a serious medical condition and can increase the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. <br><br>
                            <strong>Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.</strong>
